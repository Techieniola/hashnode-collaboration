[In a world where web3 is becoming the actuality](https://thestorywise.wordpress.com/2022/03/20/web3-the-world-that-births-crypto-episode-2%ef%bf%bc/), and existing companies across diverse industries (technology, telecommunication, health, art and entertainment) pay more attention to the realisation of the new internet structure, the Fashion industries are not excluded from this evolution.

Accordingly, [Lacoste](https://global.lacoste.com/en/homepage) joins a number of fashion luxury brands like Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga, etc to break through into web3. The official announcement was made via a well-known social media platform on Tuesday, June 14. [The brand took to its Twitter page to announce the unveiling of the new project](https://twitter.com/LACOSTE/status/1536639997096480768), ***“At 12h12 CET time, you will have the opportunity to mint a #underwater NFT. Do you know what you will get by owning the #NFT below?*** 

***Let's dig together.”***

In collaboration with Minecraft, the French luxury label will be launching a total of 11,212 NFT collectibles on the Ethereum Blockchain. This new adoption into Web3 as affirmed in the tweet below shows the concern the brand has for its customers by giving them a quality experience and the freedom to express themselves in an exclusive way.

***“As you know, you can customize our products when you order them. As a supporter of the Lacoste Experience, you will have access to unique customization. A good way to show that you're part of the community is by flexing with a unique Polo!”*** 

Together with the realisation that these customers played a significant role in their existence.

***“If Lacoste is still here after all these years, it is because of one thing: you.***

***In a world more and more connected, we think the next big step is to add you to our core team***

The further description made alongside this tweet is the 3D replication of the Brand’s logo, a crocodile, showing its face out of the water with a beaming eye. Also, the Nft will be available on Opensea.
