> You don’t want to know how many times I ever pondered on what I’ll do with my certificate after school.

***“How many people are in the World again, is it 7 billion or 8 billion?”***

Out of the 8 billion people in the World, I don’t think there's anyone as confused as I was years back when I was in school. Sometimes, I try not to think about what I’d do after school but that made it more difficult.

I’ll tell you why.

I studied English language Education at the University and inarguably, with my course of study, there’s only one thing visible to me.

**<mark>“TO TEACH!”</mark>**

You don’t want to know how many times I ever pondered on what I’ll do with my certificate after school. Sometimes I evaluate my interest to see if I really want to become a Teacher or a Lecturer

Now If you ask, “How did you end up with the course?”

I’d tell you it just happened. I wanted to go to University so badly that I didn’t even have a plan. I was very young but my dream was to further my education and of course, leave the house.

It happened as I wanted, passed every required examination in one sitting but was that all?

Not sure!

### **How do I fit in?**

> *"...Ibukun, what do you do, what can you say you do?”*

Back then, if you were to talk about career, I was clueless but this made me curious as to what I can do, I started attending a lot of career seminars, and my elder sister had a side gig that was planning events. In the blink of an eye, I saw myself attending lots of tech conferences through her, I became exposed to something new but very tricky.

**Why was it tricky?**

**How was it tricky?**

I’ll explain, whenever I go to these conferences, what I hear was either, “coding, website development, hackathon, stack or javascript.”

It wasn’t making sense!

"what in God’s name are these guys talking about?” I muttered under my breath one day while listening to a guest speaker.

To worsen it, there's usually a networking session where people are expected to move around and meet 2,3,4,5 individuals that they don’t know.

At that point, I would shy away!

Because my fear was, If anyone walks up to me, what do I even say,

Ibukun, what do you do, what can you say you do?

These worries were taking a hold of me but I was still interested in tech, not like I had any option left.

On the flip side, to try this whole coding thing, I and a close friend decided to go for a coding class.

# ***Not much longer my interest level became a negative slope that went from high to low***

The first few days, we were very much interested and happy about the decision we made.

We were taught CSS and I enjoyed the practical classes till everything started becoming a mystery.

I was the first to say, “I’m not doing this again” while she (my friend) attended a few more classes, although it didn’t take her much time to say this, “Ibukun I’ll focus on graphic designs, that is where my passion is”

I laughed when she uttered those words, but inwardly I was not happy with the outcome. With all these incidences, You’d agree with me that I needed direction. I had a conversation with my sister and she told me how the tech ecosystem is and how my talent could be relevant.

“Ibukun you are a writer, you love writing, develop yourself in it and you will stay relevant in the tech space”

My God!

You don’t want to know how courageous I became after those words of affirmation.

> ### ***To upsurge my courage on being a content writer, I became a blogger***

It was to the point that I always looked forward to the next tech event and suddenly, attending tech events became a 5 unit course for me. Going for these seminars made me more confident and when asked what I am currently doing, I would say “I am a content writer!”

I graduated from the University with this mindset, the conviction was so strong that I did not attempt to register or write my faculty’s professional examination (TRCN).

***To upsurge my courage on being a content writer, I became a blogger***

I was done with school and I definitely knew my career path, It was time to focus on developing myself.

A friend told me about her WordPress blog and how easily she created one herself. I decided to create a blog too. I downloaded the WordPress app, together with some writing and keyword tools on my phone. I started by writing some series (not tech-related), articles, and movie synopsis then published them.

I was happy and I thought I was getting things figured out until it seems like I'm back to square1.
