**“The world we are about to bisect isn’t the universe, don’t think too far”**

This world is a different world that develops over time thereby changing the future of the internet and converting what was impossible into possible.

The name given to the above-mentioned world is **WEB.**

To have an idea, it is popularly known as the **“world wide web (WWW).”** The web can only be accessed through the internet. More searches, usage and inventions from we humans caused the web to expand its features.

Breaking down the web into bits:

First, we had **web1**: this was in operation from 1990 - early 2000. It was the earliest version of the internet where people could only read and not contribute. Every user depended on the static pages for any search. It was a **read-only** era and the few people who had access to publishing articles online were either journalists, newscasters or editors, because what was predominant then was **print media.**

**An imaginative instance of the web1 era;**

[**techieniola.yahoo.com**](http://techieniola.yahoo.com)**. is a site owned by a top media company for publishing news. Everyone checking the sites can only read news and leave, without dropping comments, suggestions or even liking articles.**

As smartphones became widely used and people were able to create their own content web1 evolved into web2.

**Web2** was referred to as the **social web** or **read-write web** because it encouraged interactions between humans and websites. With web2 users can now become content creators but through **middlemen** like [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/), [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/login?lang=en), etc.

Web2 existed between **2000-2010**, but the argument that web 2 still exists, remains. This web was built on a **client-server structure**. That is, the **user** was the **client** while the **company** was the **server**.

**A practical representation of the web2 era;**

[**https://techieniola.hashnode.dev/**](https://techieniola.hashnode.dev/) **is a site owned by a young lady to create educative and informative content for the public. Also, without ignoring the possibility that each published post can be engaged with through comments, likes and shares. In this case, techieniola, is the user and** [**hashnode**](https://hashnode.com/) **is the company or the server used.**

The next development stage is called **Web3** also called the **semantic web** or **read-write-own era** **(2010** **till date).** In this era, people create, consume and own content that can be shared among themselves and others **(peer-peer)**.

Basically, web3 is the decentralised internet of the future. A system that guarantees users’ freedom and ownership right.

**WEB3 is the PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET!**
